                    Hurricane Nicole continues to drag over the northern Bahamas this morning and it will be fed by warm waters as it heads towards the Atlantic coast of Florida. Nicole made landfall around 3 a.m. this morning near Vero Beach. It will drag through central and northern Florida throughout the day today and make its way into southern Georgia by tonight. A cold front will approach the Eastern Seaboard Friday, ejecting Nicole northeast to the Mid-Atlantic by the evening, but not before it makes impact in the Carolinas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hurricane conditions and dangerous storm surge are continuing in the Bahamas tonight. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal along the immediate coast of the northwestern Bahamas. Rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches are likely, with locally higher amounts up to 8 inches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the U.S., it is important to remember that you will not get a full scope of a storm’s impacts by just looking at the center of storm. Nicole is a large storm, meaning that its influence will be felt far away from the center of circulation. This is particularly concerning for Florida’s northeastern coast, which has been experiencing exceptional high tides all ready. In fact, Altamaha Sound, Ga., south to Palm Beach, Fla., may see storm surges of 3 to 5 feet, including the St. Johns River near Jacksonville, which is prone to flooding. Hallandale Beach to North Palm Beach, Fla., may see 2 to 4 feet storm surges while Hallandale Beach to Ocean Reef may see storm surges of 1 to 2 feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Nicole's broad wind field, much of Florida into Georgia could see tropical storm-force winds as it moves onshore. Hurricane-force winds would be limited to the storm's center across the coast of southeast and east-central Florida this morning. However, with the storm expected to weaken into a tropical storm shortly after landfall, hurricane-force winds will no longer present an issue, but tropical-storm force winds will continue to be an issue for central and northern Florida, as well as Georgia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of rainfall, the eastern, central and northern positions of the Florida Peninsula will see 3 to 5 inches with localized amounts up to 7 inches possible. The Southeast into the southern and central Appalachians, as well as the western Mid-Atlantic, Tennesee, Kentucky, and Ohio will see 2 to 4 inches while the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England, primarily along Interstate 95, will see 1 to 4 inches of rain as the ejection east occurs late Friday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the 2022 hurricane season got off to a slow start, with only three tropical storms through August 31 – and an August completely bereft of named storms – the past few weeks have more than made up for lost time. Eleven named storms and seven hurricanes have formed since the start of September, including major Hurricane Ian, which ravaged Florida and South Carolina in late September.
